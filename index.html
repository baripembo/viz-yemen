          <p>More than five years of conflict have left 80 percent of Yemen’s population (over 24 million people) dependent on humanitarian assistance and protection. Continued funding shortages and travel restrictions due to the coronavirus are putting aid operations at risk.</p>

          <h3>Fighting in Al Hudaydah City</h3>
          <p>In November 2017, fighting reached the neighbourhood in the Al Hali District in Al Hudaydah, where Ali lived with his wife, Fariha, and three children. Several residents were killed and others were severely injured by stray bullets and indiscriminate shelling. Soon, the area became deserted as people fled the fighting. Ali and his family decided to leave too.</p>
          <p>They fled using a neighbour’s donkey cart, leaving most of their belongings behind, and went to a nearby neighbourhood and stayed with relatives. Three days later, as shelling drew closer, the family left Al Hudaydah for Bayt Al Faqih, where Ali’s father had once lived.</p>

          <h3>Bayt Al Faqih [stay: 4-5 days]</h3>
          <p>In Bayt Al Faqih, the family knew no one and slept outside next to a mosque for three days. As the fighting drew closer again, Ali and Fariha decided to head for Aden, but armed men at a checkpoint refused to let them pass. As they couldn’t follow the main road to Aden, they decided to go through Taizz City.</p>
          <p>((Images followed by quote)) “We didn’t have any relatives here, no place to stay, nothing to eat. The baker gave us bread and water, but we had nothing.”</p>
          <p>The family lived on water and bread donated by a local bakery. Ali borrowed 8,000 Yemeni rials (around US$20) to pay a bus driver to take them to Taizz City, driving through rugged terrain to avoid detection. Gunmen at checkpoints on the outskirts of Taizz City only allowed them to pass when they said they were visiting relatives.</p>

          <h3>Taizz City [stay: one week]</h3>
          <p>Ali and Fariha had never been this far away from home. They were exhausted and did not know where to go. They lived on food donated by residents in the area. While in Taizz City, Ali learned from former neighbours that his house in Al Hudaydah had been looted and all the family’s belongings stolen. He thought about how he had lost everything except his family in less than two weeks.</p>
          <p>A few days later, people advised Ali to take his family to a displacement site in a school in Dar Sad in Aden Governorate, where they could get help from aid agencies. Other displaced families, who had managed to pool enough money to pay a bus driver to take them to Aden, agreed to let the family travel with them on the 130 kilometer long ride.</p>

          <h3>Arrival in Aden (ongoing) </h3>
          <p>When the family finally reached the school in Dar Sad District where the displacement site was located, they found that all classrooms were occupied. They had no choice but to sleep in the schoolyard. As of June 2020, Aden Governorate hosts 26 IDP sites (nine of which are located in Dar Sad District) with over 11,000 internally displaced people, in addition to numerous other IDP families who live with host families or rent their own accommodation.</p>
          <p>Aid agencies erected a tent for the family and provided them with food rations and cash assistance. Ali and his family had access to clean water from tanks installed at the site. Ali occasionally earned a little money from working as a labourer but the family depended on assistance provided by aid organizations.</p>
